1 what is your understanding of blockchain.

Ans - blockchain is a chain of n number of block in which 
every block has their own data like number of transactions and
Every block has a special fingerprint called signature. In 
blockchain every block connected to the next block and so on.

We can understand it with help of an example :- the first block in 
blockchain is called initial block which is block 1
A+B = C, where B represent by data and C is represent by signature.
Block 2 
C+D = E, where C is previous signature and D is new data and so on.

And this n number of chain of blocks represent the blockchain.

Blockchain is a technology which provide us every transaction happens
in the entire system with the security, transparency 
and decentralisation.


2 what is the core problem blockchain trying to solve ?

Ans  The core problem which blockchain trying to solve is 
provide tthe security as a middle in which no hacking
is happen and there is no one as third party with the
transparency of data.

3 what are the few features which blockchain will give you

Ans - verifiable
      Unchangeable
      Temper proof
      Immutable

4 what all things does a blockchain contain ?

Ans - Blockchain contains n number of blocks  in which
each block have data(number of transactions) , a key
( signature ) and each block is connected to next one and
distributes across various computers.

5 How is the verfiability of blockchain is been attained ?

Ans -Suppose the same data is stored in 100 number of computers
at different different places and one person is enter the wrong
key than the other 99 respond that, it's wrong and it is change
by help of nearest person.
The data can be store at n number of systems.
